## Motivations
There's a less liquidity of the NFT on Arbitrum. If the liquiity is not enough, whales cannot get into the NFT space, because there's not any exit.
Providing more liquidity is essential for the development of NFTs tokenising non-financial digital assets. It would be the first step of the implementation of MetaFi which is the integration of MetaVerse and DeFi.

Arbitrum has a huge potential for MetaFi. There are great DeFi systems and great NFT communities, such as TreasureDAO, GMX Blueberry Club etc... It is essential to provide cross-chain liquidity on 0xAxe for MetaFi to develop on Arbitrum.

## Solutions
**Cross chain liquidity pool for NFT(ERC721). Pool for multichain ERC20 and ERC721 on Arbitrum.**

## Future works
- [ ] develop Cross-chain ERC721 liquidity with NFT bridge by Arbitrum: 
Users can create a liquidity pool with ERC20/ERC721 on other chains. 

## Others 
In the near future, we'll be able to stake every fungible-token and non-fungible-token in pools on every chains. We'll be able to choose a pool/chain based on APR, safety, utility etc...
